                From Nitro to Steel
            </h4>
            <div class="article">
                <h1>From Nitro to Steel: How Portland's AUDL Team Reinvented Its Identity</h1>
    
                <p>In 2024, Portland's semi-professional Ultimate Frisbee team underwent a striking transformation, rebranding from the <span class="highlight">Portland Nitro</span> to the <span class="highlight">Portland Steel</span>—a change that reflects both the city's industrial soul and the team's evolving identity. This shift isn't just a name swap; it's a statement about resilience, community, and the gritty spirit of Portland itself.</p>
                
                <h2>The Meaning Behind the Names</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Nitro (2021–2023)</span>: The original name captured explosive energy, speed, and the high-octane style of Ultimate. It mirrored the team's fast breaks and flashy plays, embodying the adrenaline of the sport.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Steel (2024–present)</span>: The new identity pays homage to Portland's industrial roots—from its historic steel bridges to its blue-collar work ethic. Steel represents <span class="highlight">strength, durability, and adaptability</span>, qualities that define both the team and the city.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>A Nod to Portland's Culture</h2>
                <p>Portland is a city of makers, artists, and fighters. The <span class="highlight">Steel Bridge</span>, a century-old icon, symbolizes connection and endurance—just like Ultimate, which thrives on teamwork and perseverance. The rebrand embraces this legacy, aligning the team with the unyielding spirit of Portlanders who weather storms (literal and metaphorical) together.</p>
                
                <h2>What It Means for the Team</h2>
                <p>The Steel aren't just changing jerseys; they're doubling down on <span class="highlight">community and grit</span>. The name reflects a shift from "flash" to "foundation," prioritizing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Long-term growth</span> in Portland's Ultimate scene</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Youth engagement</span>, inspiring the next generation of players</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Resilience</span>, both on the field (grinding out wins) and off (building a lasting franchise)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>A Fresh Chapter</h2>
                <p>While Nitro was about sparking excitement, Steel is about <span class="highlight">enduring impact</span>. As the team forges ahead, it carries Portland's identity with it—strong, unbreakable, and united.</p>
